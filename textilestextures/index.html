            Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus envisioned a new world–one where the material world coexisted with the arts. This utopian mindset in the early twentieth century was considered a radical concept. At its crux, Gropius sought out to develop an institute that implemented a practical curriculum for students come artisans and designers, who would create objects that were both practical and pleasing to the eye.

The Bauhaus education was one of a kind–it combined both a fine arts education with hands on, practical design experience for students. Students and educators came from diverse educational and social backgrounds. In its first ‘immersion’ year, students studied “materials, color theory, and formal relationships taught by visual artists,”. (Winton)

One of its most notable however, was Joseph Albers who like many, taught students through the philosophy of “arts through craft”. Born in 1818 in Bottrop Germany, Albers began his formal career as an artist at the Bauhaus at 22 as a student. Equally emphasizing the importance of artistic and technical skill, the preliminary curriculum prepared students not only for further coursework, but life. Within these central concepts (of artistic ability and technical skill), ‘contrast’ was at the basis–whether it be texture or form. For Joseph Albers, it was color.<br><br>

In 1925, just three years after beginning at the Bauhaus, Albers was appointed as a mentor. In 1933, the school was shut down by the Nazi party. He moved to the United States alongside his wife Anni, who both taught at the Black Mountain College in North Carolina. 

While its run short, the Bauhaus is held in the highest regard for birthing a movement-come-lifestyle. In less than a year, the Bauhaus will enter its 100th anniversary, and be celebrated for its ‘innovative’, ‘forward thinking’, and ‘utopian’ characteristics. But why? By creating an institution which valued the practical and beautiful?<br><br>

This is nothing new. Andean textiles played an integral part in the Bauhaus. This is not to say that the Bauhaus did not appreciate them–but that what they valued was nothing new. “[Textiles] provided a unique model of ancient products that a united structural engineering and fine art while serving as a paradigm from which to legitimize and reaffirm modern aesthetic and social theories,” (Gardner Troy, 1).

Ancient American textiles assume many forms, blankets, garments, and tapestries, and are regarded as “primitive”. Despite the term, primitivism and its textiles made their way into the Bauhaus thanks to the Albers. Andean textiles expressed a structural and social need in a way that modern weavers did not. 


<br><br><i>“It  is interesting that early  twentieth century  Primitivist discourse in Germany concerned textiles.  Textiles from  many
cultures  and  epochs  provided  artists  and  art  theorists  with tangible models to engage in both the applied  arts reformation  movement  and  in Modernist  Primitivism. Artists  chose to work  in  fiber  as an alternative to the  European  painting tradition. For example, the Die Brücke artist Ernst  Ludwig
Kirchner,  decorated and hung textiles  in  his Beriin  studio in 1912 in order to create an environment where art and
life merged as one, as "primitive" people would have done.”</i><br><br>
The aesthetic value of applied art of textiles have been addressed in the past for their 'example for contemporary art'. It is ironic to find primitiveness in applied art and replicate it as a craft. Why not just appreciate its form, aesthetic value, and address the practical, forwardthinking 
minds of those who created them?<br><br>
As time passes, technologies progress and art takes on these new forms. Where do we see textiles in the modern age besides the gallery space? How can we apply new technologies to concepts once considered primitive, which are all encompassing? <b><i>Are we able to sustain the social implications of textiles in the modern age or honor only their aesthetic legitimacy? </i></b>
 Dr. Martin Wooley and designer Robert Huddleston discuss the ‘human touch’ and ‘crafted control’ within the field of advanced textile production in <i>Crafting Textiles In The Digital Age<i>
