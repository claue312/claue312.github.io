            Founded in 1919 by Walter Gropius, the Bauhaus envisioned a new world–one where the material world coexisted with the arts. This utopian mindset in the early twentieth century was considered a radical concept. At its crux, Gropius sought out to develop an institute that implemented a practical curriculum for students come artisans and designers, who would create objects that were both practical and pleasing to the eye.

The Bauhaus education was one of a kind–it combined both a fine arts education with hands on, practical design experience for students. Students and educators came from diverse educational and social backgrounds. In its first ‘immersion’ year, students studied “materials, color theory, and formal relationships taught by visual artists,”. (Winton)

One of its most notable however, was Joseph Albers who like many, taught students through the philosophy of “arts through craft”. Born in 1818 in Bottrop Germany, Albers began his formal career as an artist at the Bauhaus at 22 as a student. Equally emphasizing the importance of artistic and technical skill, the preliminary curriculum prepared students not only for further coursework, but life. Within these central concepts (of artistic ability and technical skill), ‘contrast’ was at the basis–whether it be texture or form. For Joseph Albers, it was color.<br><br>

In 1925, just three years after beginning at the Bauhaus, Albers was appointed as a mentor. In 1933, the school was shut down by the Nazi party. He moved to the United States alongside his wife Anni, who both taught at the Black Mountain College in North Carolina. During a visit to Peru in 1953, Anni and Josef connected their existing knowledge of the textile craft, patterns, and geometry. But this time, it was different. “This couple for whom making art was the center of life, was hauntingly drawn to what they perceived as a culture and society in which creativity and invention were profoundly embedded values,” (Danilowitz). 


While its run short, the Bauhaus is held in the highest regard for birthing a movement-come-lifestyle. In less than a year, the Bauhaus will enter its 100th anniversary, and be celebrated for its ‘innovative’, ‘forward thinking’, and ‘utopian’ characteristics. But why? By creating an institution which valued the practical and beautiful?<br><br>

This is nothing new. Andean textiles played an integral part in the Bauhaus. This is not to say that the Bauhaus did not appreciate them–but that what they valued was nothing new. “[Textiles] provided a unique model of ancient products that a united structural engineering and fine art while serving as a paradigm from which to legitimize and reaffirm modern aesthetic and social theories,” (Gardner Troy, 1).

Ancient American textiles assume many forms, blankets, garments, and tapestries, and are regarded as “primitive”. Despite the term, primitivism and its textiles made their way into the Bauhaus thanks to the Albers. Andean textiles expressed a structural and social need in a way that modern weavers did not. 


<br><br><i>“It  is interesting that early  twentieth century  Primitivist discourse in Germany concerned textiles.  Textiles from  many
cultures  and  epochs  provided  artists  and  art  theorists  with tangible models to engage in both the applied  arts reformation  movement  and  in Modernist  Primitivism. Artists  chose to work  in  fiber  as an alternative to the  European  painting tradition. For example, the Die Brücke artist Ernst  Ludwig
Kirchner,  decorated and hung textiles  in  his Beriin  studio in 1912 in order to create an environment where art and
life merged as one, as "primitive" people would have done.”</i><br><br>
The aesthetic value of applied art of textiles have been addressed in the past for their 'example for contemporary art'. It is ironic to find primitiveness in applied art and replicate it as a craft. Why not just appreciate its form, aesthetic value, and address the practical, forwardthinking 
minds of those who created them?<br><br>
As time passes, technologies progress and art takes on these new forms. Where do we see textiles in the modern age besides the gallery space? How can we apply new technologies to concepts once considered primitive, which are all encompassing? <b><i>Are we able to sustain the social implications of textiles in the modern age or honor only their aesthetic legitimacy? </i></b>
Dr. Martin Wooley and designer Robert Huddleston discuss the ‘human touch’ and ‘crafted control’ within the field of advanced textile production in <i>Crafting Textiles In The Digital Age</i>. Specifically, they explain how heterogenous (wood) and homogenous (clay) materials can impact workmanship and the final outcome. As manufacturing has become a standardized process, workmanship has come into question. Of course–these technologies have granted us many conveniences. However, irregularities in work done by an artisan were also considered a source of beauty, such as a missed stitch, a wrinkle in leather, or the uninintentional smear of paint. (Huddleston, Wooley). <br><br>
   
As we continue to innovate manufacturing processes, make art (applied and non-applied), how do we maintain authenticity and uniqueness going forward? Should we focus on materials or the process of making, or both?
“Production practices have begun to offer a unique proposition in which creative risk-taking can be contrived, which much more emphasis on the calculation of risk. In other words, the “operator/crafter” has the possibility of of determining the precise degree of predictable/unpredictable intervention possible in a given project,” (Huddleston, Wooley). I think the best way to handle the aspect of ‘authenticity’ of art in modern textiles (and all applied arts)   is to consider history.  The desire to innovate is in our blood–but it not something to criticize.  As we consider the beginning of applied arts and as it became defined as ‘design’, it is critical to address Andean textiles. I think of the purpose they serve practically, socially, and politically. In the present day we must factor in manufacturing processes, the innovation of materials, aesthetics, authenticity, and purpose. 

Authenticity and purpose, however, converge, especially in the present day. In terms of applied art, we mustn’t criticize the lack of authenticity of a piece of art or design, but consider its purpose and how it is utilizing available materials to create a better piece. 

<br><br>

We should now view authenticity in a new light. Perhaps, we should shift away from the term authenticity altogether, and try to understand why one values it. Because of its scarcity and uniqueness? Most of our the textiles that we wear and use are manufactured on the mass scale. With that being said, the bulk of these see few imperfections, as they strive for the most consistency possible. While I do not see this changing any time soon, I do see room for change for intended use. Textiles can sense and retain the history of its user “through the accumulation of sweat, hair, stains, or tears. They sense and record personal histories that can be communicated visually or through other senses,” (Berzowska, Joanna).When the industry has been homogenized the most logical option is to utilize available resources to innovate to benefit the greater good.<br><br>
Josef and Anni Albers paid homage to ancient Andean textiles by bringing this craft back to the Bauhaus, and teaching its future students. At the time, the Bauhaus was cutting edge by combining traditional craftsmanship and new techniques to train the best designers in the world. While some of their counterparts still considered this practice to be ‘primitive’, the Albers understood that the cultural implications were far greater than its practicality as a woven good. Going forward, authenticity simply must be viewed differently. We cannot go back in time. Manufacturing has been perfected. Now, something that is authentic is something that is innovative, whether it be crafted from a cutting edge material, or crafted in a way that hasn’t be done before. Innovation is authenticity. <br><br>


<b>For this webpage, I have coded a 'textile' inspired by Josef Albers. I found it appropriate, paying homage to his applied art with a new medium. Despite it being created with code, it isn't any less authentic or unique than if I had drawn it by hand, as the code behind it is more unique than the design itself! Puts everything into perspective :)</b>
