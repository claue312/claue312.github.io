    <h3>Alisha's husband, Simon, has his birthday tomorrow. She wants to give him an 
      special gift, but he seems to already have it all...</h3>
<div class="c c2"><img src="assets/img/maxi.jpg"/></div>
    <h3>Alisha calls her best friend, Sveta, to consult about gift giving. After much
      speculation, Sveta recommends giving him an experiential gift. She knows of a great
      day spa just 30 minutes shy of Hidden Springs. "I actually need to run an errand in
      that direction...I could pick up a spa certicate if you don't mind watching Wayne!"
      explains Sveta. Alisha pauses and contemplates. She's flattered by Sveta's offer, but 
      hesitates because of her hatred of young children. </div>
<div class="c c3"><img src="assets/img/alish.jpg"/></div>
      <h3> Alisha agrees to take care of Sveta's baby. She walks three doors down to 
        Sveta's house. She explains that the baby is in the crib upstairs, sleeping. Alisha
      goes into Sveta's house to find the child.  </h3>
