  <h3>Childhood in The Sims can either be the state a Sim was created in, or attained after 72 game hours as a baby. Children do not grow older, and cannot gain skill points. Premade children have no skills. Kids created in Create a Sim may have random or no skills, but children born in-game will always have random skills. They will not be able to use most of them, but children who get high creativity can earn money by painting at an easel.</h3>
